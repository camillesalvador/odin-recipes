    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>250 g rigatoni</li>
      <li>150 g baby spinach</li>
      <li>2 shallots</li>
      <li>40 g pistachios</li>
      <li>100 g Parmesan cheese (grated)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 lemon</li>
      <li>150 ml pasta water</li>
      <li>60 g butter</li>
      <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season with salt. Meanwhile,
        wash the lemon under hot water and zest it. Halve the shallots and cut
        them into fine strips. Finely chop garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pasta to boiling water and cook according to package instructions.
        At the end of the pasta cooking time, reserve some cooking water.
        Meanwhile, continue with the recipe. In a large frying pan, melt a third
        of the butter. Add pistachios, shallot strips, and sugar and sauté until
        butter is browned and shallots are lightly caramelized for approx. 4 - 6
        min. Remove from pan and set aside in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat more oil in the same frying pan. Add garlic and sauté for 1 min.
        until translucent. Add cooked pasta and deglaze everything with reserved
        pasta cooking water. Bring to a boil and add the remaining butter.
        Reserve some grated Parmesan cheese for garnish, and add most of it to
        the pasta. Mix everything thoroughly. Continue cooking and stirring
        until the pasta is coated with sauce and becomes glossy, for about 4
        min.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add baby spinach to the pasta, mix, and let it wilt. Season pasta with a
        little salt and lemon zest. Then season generously with pepper. Arrange
        pasta on deep plates, top with pistachios and shallots, and garnish with
        remaining lemon zest and parmesan. Serve immediately.
