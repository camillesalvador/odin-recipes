    <p>
      "Miso soup is about a good dashi broth. In this recipe, we will show you
      how to make the dashi at home (it’s easy!), but you could also buy
      pre-made dashi or dashi powder and use that instead. The homemade dashi
      can be adjusted to be more intense in flavor by adding more bonito flakes
      or soaking the kombu in cold water for a few hours (instead of minutes)
      before cooking. It can stored in the fridge for up to 5 days after you
      make it. To make sure the miso is integrated completely with no lumps in
      the final soup, it’s usually added into the soup through a small sieve,
      but here we instead whisked it together with hot broth in a small bowl
      before adding it to the soup. Miso soup is traditionally made with wakame
      (a type of seaweed) and tofu, but can be made with many ingredients, such
      as other green leafy vegetables, daikon radish, or mushrooms."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp miso paste</li>
      <li>250 g silken tofu</li>
      <li>1 scallion</li>
      <li>80 g baby spinach</li>
      <li>10 g kombu</li>
      <li>15 g bonito flakes</li>
      <li>1¼ l water (cold)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To prepare the dashi (the broth for the soup), add kombu to a pot with
        cold water and heat over medium-low until hot and just simmering. Let
        simmer very gently for approx. 8 – 10 min., don’t let it come to a boil!
        Skim the foam off the surface of the dashi while simmering. Remove the
        kombu, bring to a boil, and add bonito flakes. Continue boiling for
        approx. 1 min., then turn off the heat and let sit uncovered for approx.
        10 min. Drain through a fine sieve set over a bowl to collect the clear
        dashi.
      </li>
      <li>In the meantime, thinly slice scallions. Drain and cube tofu.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer dashi to a pot over medium heat. Add miso paste to a small bowl
        and spoon some hot dashi into the bowl. Whisk it well until all lumps
        are broken up, then add the miso mixture to the pot and let cook for
        approx. 2 min. Lower the heat, add tofu and cook briefly. Remove from
        the heat and add baby spinach just to wilt. Serve immediately, garnished
        with scallions. Enjoy!
