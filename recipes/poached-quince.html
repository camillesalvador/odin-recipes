      "This recipe for dessert was created by Christian and me during a video
      challenge to create an impromptu 3-course-dinner, taking inspiration from
      ingredients given to us. Head to our Youtube channel to watch the video!
      This easy, but very ‘cheffy’ dessert recipe shows you how you can elevate
      everyday ingredients, just like a chef, and create something completely
      restaurant-worthy."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 quince</li>
      <li>250 g mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>120 g sugar</li>
      <li>100 ml white wine</li>
      <li>1 star anise</li>
      <li>4 sprigs rosemary</li>
      <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>30 g hazelnuts</li>
      <li>1 sheet puff pastry sheet</li>
      <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
      <li>confectioner’s sugar (for dusting)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To prepare the dashi (the broth for the soup), add kombu to a pot with
        cold water and heat over medium-low until hot and just simmering. Let
        simmer very gently for approx. 8 – 10 min., don’t let it come to a boil!
        Skim the foam off the surface of the dashi while simmering. Remove the
        kombu, bring to a boil, and add bonito flakes. Continue boiling for
        approx. 1 min., then turn off the heat and let sit uncovered for approx.
        10 min. Drain through a fine sieve set over a bowl to collect the clear
        dashi.
      </li>
      <li>In the meantime, thinly slice scallions. Drain and cube tofu.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer dashi to a pot over medium heat. Add miso paste to a small bowl
        and spoon some hot dashi into the bowl. Whisk it well until all lumps
        are broken up, then add the miso mixture to the pot and let cook for
        approx. 2 min. Lower the heat, add tofu and cook briefly. Remove from
        the heat and add baby spinach just to wilt. Serve immediately, garnished
        with scallions. Enjoy!
